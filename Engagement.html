				  <p><em>In order to expand the field of synthetic biology, education is essential.  Our team is passionate about fostering a love for science and engineering in younger members of our community and engaging with parents about how iGEM research can produce cutting-edge solutions to real-world problems.  Every year, we volunteer at local science fairs and STEM events, sharing our work and promoting interest in the biological sciences.  This year, we participated in a record number of events for our team and developed a versatile set of activities that are easily tailored to different formats and age groups, related to DNA, synthetic biology, and genetic engineering.  We are making basic protocols for these activities available for other teams to use below.</em></p>

					        <b>Background:</b>
					        <p>Enzymes are large molecules (proteins) that are found in living cells.  Different kinds of enzymes can perform all kinds of tasks in your body.  Some enzymes (like catalase) can break bonds, like those in hydrogen peroxide, that would be hard to break with other methods.</p>
					        <div class="container" style="text-align: center">2H₂O₂ → 2H₂O + O₂(gas)</div><br />
					        <p>Hydrogen peroxide is harmful to cells, so cells use catalase to break it down into harmless byproducts (oxygen and water).  Enzymes can work only under certain conditions (namely, a specific range of temperature and pH).  This experiment is meant to explore how enzymes work and the effects on pH and temperature on their activity.</p>

								<li>Spinach leaves</li>
								<li>Hydrogen Peroxide</li>
								<li>Large graduated cylinders (50mL-100mL)</li>
								<li>Vinegar</li>
								<li>Baking soda</li>
								<li>A microwave (optional)</li>
								<li>A freezer (optional)</li>
							</ul>
							<b>Protocol:</b>
							<ol>
								<li>Explain how enzymes work and the purpose of catalase specifically.  Introduce students to your ingredients (especially hydrogen peroxide), and have them predict what will happen when you pour it over your apples and potatoes.</li>
								<li>Place apple slices into one graduated cylinder and potato cubes into another.</li>
								<li>Pour hydrogen peroxide over the apples and observe the results.  Then pour hydrogen peroxide over the apple slices.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>No reaction should be visible.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Pour hydrogen peroxide over the potatoes and observe the results.</li>
								<ul>
									<li>The reaction should be bubbly due to the oxygen released, and should last 30-90 seconds.</li>
								</ul>
								<li>Repeat the experiment, this time placing potato cubes into both cylinders and adding vinegar to one and baking soda to the other.  Pour in hydrogen peroxide and observe.</li>
								<li>If you have the resources, repeat the experiment a third time, this time adding frozen potato cubes to one cylinder and microwaved potato cubes to the other.  Pour in hydrogen peroxide and observe.</li>
								<li>Wrap up the experiment by discussing how each condition performed, highlighting under what conditions the enzyme worked and under which conditions it was deactivated.</li>

								<li>Allot 20-30 minutes for them to discuss with each other what problem they want to tackle and how they can do it.  Have each group make a poster about their idea.  Check in with groups periodically to make sure they are staying focused and discuss their ideas with them.</li>
								<li>Give each group 1 minute to pitch their idea to a class.  They should explain what problem they are trying to solve, how their design works, and why it is useful.  As the instructor, be encouraging and ask questions.</li>
