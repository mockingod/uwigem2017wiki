 <p>Our project was inspired by the work of the Koffas lab¹. Researchers developed a  repressible promoter system using sgRNA sequences coupled with the CRISPR/dCas9 mechanism. They incorporated these promoters into the biosynthetic violacein pathway and were able to successfully throttle carbon flux in <em>E. coli</em>, effectively turning promoters into orthogonal on/off switches commanding the direction of metabolic production in bacteria. We realized the boundless implication of this method and thus decided to incorporate this construct into our yeast system. </p>
<p>In order to realize our goal of creating an autonomous yeast culture management platform, we are employing a violacein pathway to visualize metabolic processes in yeast. The pathway consists of five genes: VioA, VioB, and VioE (which are constitutively expressed), VioC and VioD. A single promoter determines expression of VioA, VioB, and VioE, so in our diagrams, the three genes are abbreviated to VioABE. The genes are controlled by inducible promoters. The Dueber Lab performed HPLC on yeast that expressed this pathway to reveal that primarily predeoxyvioacein, deoxyviolacein, proviolacein, and violacein were produced in mass quantities⁴. Culture pigment expression changes according to the following gene activation combinations: </p>
