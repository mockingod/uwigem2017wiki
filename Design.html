				  <div id="Overview" class="jumpSection"></div>
			  	  <h4 class="subSection">Overview</h4>
 				  <p> This year’s drylab hardware project began with a review of the previous year’s designs and concepts. The previous project had produced a workable syringe pump, but little else. The general idea of a control system had been suggested, but not yet implemented. Because the project required an improvement of the pump, a set of sensors, and a system of responsive real-time control, we decided to begin by dividing the task into the following categories and domains of responsibility.</p>

 				  <div class="container" style="text-align: center; align-content: center">
 				  	<table class="table table-hover table-sm table-striped" style="max-width: 65%; margin: auto">
					  <thead>
					    <tr>
					      <th style="text-align: center" scope="col">Task</th>
					      <th style="text-align: center" scope="col">Responsibility</th>
					    </tr>
					  </thead>
					  <tbody>
					    <tr>
					      <td><b>Sensors</b></td>
					      <td>Choosing appropriate sensor hardware and designing ways to attach them.</td>
					    </tr>

					    <tr>

					      <td>Improvement of the syringe pump design, with focus on accuracy.</td>
					    </tr>

					    <tr>
					      <td><b>Tank</b></td>
					      <td>Research methods of delivering inducer and media fluids into the bioreactor beaker and removing waste products.</td>

			  	<div id="Raspberry&nbsp;Pi&nbsp;and&nbsp;Control" class="jumpSection"></div>
		  		<h4 class="subSection">Raspberry Pi and Control</h4>
				  <p>The Raspberry Pi is an inexpensive, credit card-sized computer. It runs on a variant of the open-source operating system, Linux. This means that it allows the use of any major development language. A Raspberry Pi can be operated by connecting a keyboard and monitor, or by accessing it remotely with a PC or major smart phone. This ease of access allowed us to choose between a broad range of approaches for software control. We chose the popular Java Swing user interface platform as our way for the user to configure and operate the system.</p>

				  <p>The general solution follows from connecting the Raspberry Pi’s low power logic system (“GPIO” pins) to a simple integrated circuit capable of turning device components on and off as required. Through our easy-to-use Java software, a user can control all of these components without the need for any special technical knowledge. </p><br/>

 				  <p>The Raspberry Pi itself is a low-voltage logic system that can’t provide much power. In our device, the Pi is connected to a circuit board that allows this low-voltage logic to control more power-intensive devices such as a heater, bubbler, and magnetic stirrer. Power to these devices comes from a low-cost PC power supply of the kind used in inexpensive desktop computers.</p><br />

 				<div id="Syringe&nbsp;Pump" class="jumpSection"></div>
			  	  <h4 class="subSection">Syringe Pump</h4>
 				  <p>The syringe pump is a 3D printed piece of PLA plastic that is attached to a threaded rod, linear slides, and a stepper motor similar to those found on 3D printers. It is controlled by a <a href="/Team:Washington/Software">program</a> we created using the Raspberry pi. It was a vital component for the Chromastat, because we needed these to input inducers into the tube. Before any long term goals were set for the syringe pump, testing needed to be done to see how well it currently performed.</p>

					<p>From testing, we found that the pump had a large endpoint variability of .1 mL. It was determined that the origin of the source of error was the screw we used to move the platform that depressed the syringe. We decided to switch over from a regular ¼” threaded rod to a 8mm lead screw, thereby reducing the amount of endpoint variability.</p>

					<p>Next, we found that there were lots of issues pertaining to the linear guide rails. We remodeled the entire system in order to fit linear slide bearings on. This made the entire movement much smoother.</p>

					<p>We decided to make the syringe pump modular, so we could introduce many different size syringes to the system. Thinner and longer syringes can be extremely accurate compared to the 3mL syringe pumps we currently use.</p>

					<p>Low-cost commercial syringe pumps lack programmability, accuracy, and the ability to refill. We wanted our pump to have all of these features. Programmability is achieved by using the Pi to control the pump. Because the control software is written in Java, the overall behavior of the pump can be easily customized to any situation by anyone with intermediate Java experience.</p>

					<p>Accuracy was achieved by the above techniques of employing linear slide bearings and an 8mm lead screw to control the linear actuation of the syringe. </p>

					<p>For automatic refilling, we employ a set of double check valves, graciously donated by Nordson Medical. These valves allows us to expel fluid when depressing the syringe and refill the syringe by drawing it back.</p>
